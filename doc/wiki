                            ========================================================================================================================================================================
This project involves development of an interactive, time-scale based visualization, which correlates  topics published by physicists over time, their  contributions/collaborations with fellow physicists and their popularity  as well as popularity of their work in subsequent years.

  Summary 
As the slider on time-scale moves forward, this visualization will help the users find:-  

     The popular physicists in a time span of an year, a decade or of all times (topic of debate now, is it?) 

     The popular topics in physics (as in, famous / discussed / most sought after) 

     On-click functionality enabling users to find the sub-fields  which those physicists were most involved with, and also showing their  collaborations (if any), with other physicists. 

     The discovery patterns of atomic/sub-atomic particles in  chronological order. For spreading awareness of how the knowledge of  physicists, increased over time.

 Skills being sought
The following skills are desired but not necessary:  

     Knowledge of physics  

     writing skills 

     web development and/or designing 

     data analysis 

     visualization 

  Weekend goals 

     Learn how to query and analyze data.  

     Search for appropriate visualization tools 

     Decide the structure of web page 

     Discuss the topics of categorizaton for showing collaborations of physicists and for showing the topics of their research 

     How to visualize the data points  

     Decide on how to correlate the data points in those categories 

     Discuss how the metadata is displayed 

  References/background material 

     The planned sources of database are: CDS / INSPIRE / ATLANTIS / other similar document servers. Example: INSPIRE Matrix of Topcites

     INVENIO  Digital Library Software

     Invenio's online running instances - Cern Document Server and INSPIRE -> High-Energy Physics Literature Database

  Requirements 
It will be best for you to look at the following things before we start. 

     Read up little about INVENIO  Digital Library Software, as in, what is it all about, what kind of data it holds.  

Briefly, Invenio is used to host websites containing searchable data  about physicists, books, proceedings, talks, preprints, articles, and so  on.  

     Read up on Data Visualizations, what are they, how do they represent data, how could one visualize data, and other similar FAQs
